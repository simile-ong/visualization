# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - GOOD EXAMPLE
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Effective visualization: Kathryn McCrindle‚Äôs ‚ÄúIV2025 Final Dashboard - Kathryn McCrindle - Wildlife Strikes‚Äù (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kathryn.mccrindle/viz/IV2025FinalDashboard-KathrynMcCrindle-WildlifeStrikes/Home)
      The infographic presents data about wildlife strikes on planes, allowing the user to arrive at their own conclusion to the main question posed, ‚ÄúAs reports of wildlife strikes continue to rise, should we be concerned?‚Äù
      The infographic is visually pleasing and communicates information clearly. The user is first presented with data on ‚ÄúAll Strikes.‚Äù Strikes on different parts of the aircraft that are indicated using points (using area as a channel to encode frequency) on an image of a plane. If the user wants more precise information, they user can hover over each point for a tooltip with the exact number of recorded strikes on each part. Beside it is a minimalistic-looking graph of the total numbers of strikes from 1990 to 2025, with clearly labelled x- and y-axes. Again, the user can hover over different parts of the line for more precise numbers. There is also a minimalistic bar graph of the top species of animals involved in strikes with specific numbers stated in tooltips, which allows the user to easily compare the different species at a glance while offering them the option to obtain more specific numbers. McCrindle‚Äôs infographic communicates the overarching tends of each dataset clearly and concisely through its minimalistic data visualization design, but offers more granular information when the user interacts with it.
      The same information for ‚ÄúStrikes with Significant Damage‚Äù is available when the user toggles to it from ‚ÄúAll Strikes.‚Äù The fact that the two infographics cannot be viewed at the same time may make it difficult to compare the two, but the fact that the data is presented in a consistent way mitigates this. The ease with which the user can toggle between the two pages also helps the user compare the two.
      This infographic is supplemented by two additional pages titled ‚ÄúDamage Cockpit‚Äù and ‚ÄúDanger Zone.‚Äù The former allows users to interact with a sliding scale to compare how different parts of the aircraft are affected by wildlife strikes over time. This infographic also allows the user to view the changes over time as an animation (chronologically and counter-chronologically).
      The latter maps the number of strikes per airport in the United States with an area graph. Users can hover over each point (with area as a channel to encode frequency) for the name of the airport, the total number of strikes, and strikes per species.
      While these infographics present a lot of data, McCrindle summarizes their key takeaways in write-ups. The cognitive load on the user is low because of the minimalistic presentation of the data and the effective division of the data into different pages.

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      To improve the infographics, I‚Äôd offer the user the option to view the different infographics on the same page for ease of reference. I‚Äôd also try to standardize the color scheme across the different pages to make them seem more cohesive.


      
      ```
    - BAD EXAMPLE
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Ineffective visualization: Fergus Smith‚Äôs ‚ÄúFast Fashion's Environmental Wake Up Call #VOTD‚Äù (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fergus.smith/viz/FastFashionsEnvironmentalWakeUpCall/Dashboard1)
      The infographic attempts to persuade the user of the negative environmental impact of the fashion industry. Its design is very eye-catching, but the data isn‚Äôt presented clearly. Overall, the graphic presents too much information, demanding high cognitive load from the user and leading to mixed messaging.
      Consider the line graph of global population vs. textile production over time, which tries to communicate how the growth of textile production outstripped population growth between 1970 to 2018. There is no x-axis to convey the progression of time. Instead, the line representing global population serves as the x-axis because its two terminal points are labelled as years instead of population numbers. (The population numbers are only revealed when the user hovers over the points.) The inconsistency in the labelling of the two lines makes this graph slightly confusing. It's also unclear when the two lines intersect, and the significance of this intersection. The graph sacrifices clarity and precision of data presentation in service of its minimalistic style.
      However, the infographic is not minimalistic when it should be. The bar graph labelled ‚ÄúSpecific industry‚Äôs environmental (pulse) score‚Äù is quite confusing because it presents too much data. Using the thickness of the bars to communicate market share isn‚Äôt strategic because the arrangement of the bars makes it quite difficult to compare this metric. For the purposes of the infographic, the market share of companies seems to be extraneous data; its relevance to companies‚Äô environmental impact is unclear. The main takeaway of the graph is stated under the graph ‚Äì (1) ‚Äúgiant ‚Äòfast fashion‚Äô brands are not inherently harmful to the environment [i.e. have a better pulse score] or economy‚Äù; and (2) ‚Äúsmaller brands‚Ä¶ make up a greater market share score poorly‚Äù. The use of the green check and red cross next to the two statements are confusing because it's unclear if they signify ‚Äúgood‚Äù and ‚Äúbad‚Äù respectively or ‚Äútrue‚Äù and ‚Äúfalse.‚Äù  The first statement also contradicts the subtitle of the infographic ‚Äúfast fashion‚Äôs environmental wake up call‚Äù ‚Äì are fast fashion brands problematic or not?

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      To improve upon this infographic, I‚Äôd first decide what the main message of the infographic is and who my target audience is. The implicit goal of the infographic is to present information about the fashion industry to consumers, and to persuade them to stop overconsuming fashion products for the sake of the environment. As such I‚Äôd excise all information that‚Äôs not central to the message, like the section ‚ÄúWhat do consumers think about sustainability?‚Äù that seems to be targeted towards companies, rather than consumers. Since the messaging isn‚Äôt neutral, I‚Äôd add a short write-up of the main message of each data visualization. I‚Äôd also simplify some of the data to ensure the messaging is clear and to reduce visual clutter, like in the ‚ÄúEnvironmental (pulse) score‚Äù bar graph. I‚Äôd also add hyperlinks to sources where applicable so the user can track them down easily for reference.

      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
